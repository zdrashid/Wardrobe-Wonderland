Defintion of Game Objects: 
Avatar, Clothing and Hanger all created by me

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Animation of Game Objects Sprite Sheet: 
Hearts to represent lives were created by me and revolving 
hanger also represents as sprite sheet

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interaction Between Game Objects: 
Avatar runs and catches clothes to gain score so that is one interaction
Another interaction is that a hanger can catch clothes to earn score as well
Once clothes hit the ground lives are lost

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keeping Score:
Points are earned by catching clothes before they hit the ground. They are incremented from 10 to 20 to 30 as
the speed increases of the clothes falling. Half points are earned if the hanger you throw hits the clothes. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Complexity:
I believe this takes several aspects of other games and combines them. It takes the aspect of moving an avatar to collect
items to gain score like pacman but instead of the objects being stationary they are moving and you only move in the x plane. 
Also the hanger takes into account something like space invaders where you are shooting an object at an objective. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall look & feel:
The items are all clothes that could be part of someone's closet and the avatar has a similar look and items are 
same size as avatars clothes. The hanger almost looks like the appropriate size for the clothing. The background is 
a runway to go with the fashion theme!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Effectiveness of personal twist:
I have put myself in the game (with a slightly cooler haircut) and the game revolves around fashion because I am 
actually a fashion merchandising minor!

Demo/Gallery/YouTube:
I presented the game to the professor and adjusted some things she suggested.
Game is available on my github and the youtube video is posted for viewing.
